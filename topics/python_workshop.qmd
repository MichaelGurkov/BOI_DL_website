  # 🧠 Python for Deep Learning – 3-Hour Workshop
  
This hands-on workshop introduces the essential Python skills needed for deep learning. You'll work directly in Google Colab and practice every concept along the way.

---


```{r set_up_python, echo=FALSE}
#|echo: FALSE

if (Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE") == "C:\\Users\\internet"){
  
  python_path = paste0("C:\\Users\\internet\\AppData\\Local",
                       "\\Programs\\Python\\Python312\\python.exe")
} else {
  
  python_path = paste0("C:\\Users\\Home\\AppData\\Local",
                       "\\Programs\\Python\\Python312\\python.exe")
}

reticulate::use_python(python_path)

```


## 1. Introduction & Environment Setup

We will use **Google Colab** as our development environment, which allows you to run Python in the browser, without installing anything locally.

### Topics Covered
- Why Python for Deep Learning
- Navigating Google Colab
- Uploading files manually and via Google Drive

### Task
Upload a CSV file to Colab and display its first few rows using `pandas`.

---


```{python import_libraries}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"


import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import os


```


## 2. Python Fundamentals

Get familiar with Python’s basic building blocks: variables, lists, dictionaries, control flow, and functions.

### Topics Covered
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`
- Lists and dictionaries
- `if`, `for`, and `while` statements
- Writing and calling functions

### Task
Create a dictionary of students and their exam scores.  
Write a function that:
- Prints each student’s average score
- Returns the name of the top student

You’ll reuse this data structure in the next section to learn about NumPy.

---

```{python calculate_scores}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"


def calculate_averages(scores_dict):
  
  scores_df = pd.DataFrame(data=scores_dict.values(), index=scores_dict.keys()).T
  
  averages_df = scores_df.mean(axis = 0).sort_values(ascending=False)

  return averages_df


student_scores = {
    "Alice": [88, 92, 79],
    "Bob":   [75, 83, 80],
    "Carol": [90, 85, 95],
    "Dave":  [72, 78, 70]
}


calculate_averages(student_scores)


```



## 3. Numerical Computing with NumPy

Learn to work with arrays and vectors using NumPy, Python’s core numerical library.

### Topics Covered
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays
- Indexing, slicing, shapes, reshaping
- Element-wise operations and broadcasting
- Matrix multiplication and axis-based operations

### Task
Use the student-score data from the previous task:
- Convert it to a NumPy array
- Compute average scores using matrix multiplication
- Print each student’s average based on the computed result

---

```{python }

student_names = list(student_scores.keys())
grade_lists = list(student_scores.values())  # list of lists, one per student

# Step 3: Convert to NumPy array and transpose
# Original shape: (n_students, n_exams) → Transpose to (n_exams, n_students)
grades_matrix = np.array(grade_lists).T

# Step 4: Create a weight vector to compute averages (equal weights)
n_exams = grades_matrix.shape[0]
weights = np.ones((n_exams, 1)) / n_exams  # shape: (n_exams, 1)

# Step 5: Matrix multiplication → result shape: (n_students, 1)
averages = grades_matrix.T @ weights  # (n_students, n_exams) x (n_exams, 1)

# Step 6: Display results
for name, avg in zip(student_names, averages.flatten()):
    print(f"{name}: {avg:.2f}")

```



## 4. Working with Data

Most real-world deep learning tasks start with data in files. This section shows how to load and prepare it.

### Topics Covered
- Reading CSV files using `pandas`
- Exploring the dataset (`.head()`, `.describe()`)
- Extracting features and labels as NumPy arrays
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`

### Task
Load a planar dataset with columns `x1`, `x2`, and `label`:
- Show class distribution
- Extract features (`X`) and labels (`y`)
- Standardize features for use in a model

---

## 5. Logistic Regression vs Neural Network

We'll train two models on the same planar data:
  - A logistic regression (linear decision boundary)
- A shallow neural network (non-linear decision boundary)

### Topics Covered
- Building models with `Sequential`
- Adding layers with `Dense`
- Compiling and training with `fit`
- Comparing results across models

### Task
Using the prepared planar dataset:
  - Train a logistic regression model (1 layer)
- Train a neural network with one hidden layer
- Compare accuracy of both on a test set

---
  
  ## 6. Wrap-Up and Next Steps
  
  ### Topics Covered
  - What you've learned so far
- Recommended resources to go further

### Task
Create a Python function that prints what you learned today.  
Store each section and a short summary in a dictionary, and iterate over it to print the output.
